# A Steam bulk CD-KEY redeemer
An easy to use bulk CD-KEY activation script for Steam, based off [this gist as the base](https://gist.github.com/salarsen/97a11d29baeb96b37489965bc8966646)

## Requirements and Setup
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the script folder to install all necessary pip libraries.

## How to use
1. Run the requirements.txt file to get all the needed libraries.
2. Add the CD-KEYS you are wanting to redeem in the `codes.txt` text file.
3. Run `main.py` script and follow all input prompts.
4. Your CD-Keys will now be redeemed automatically.
5. Report any issues to this repository to be investigated with screenshot(s) of the error if possible :D

## Limitations
The only known limitation is Steam currently rate limits the amount of CD-Keys you can redeem to around 50 CD-Key redeems every 1-2 hours. So you may need to rerun the script multiple times if you are redeeming more than 50 CD-Keys from the list.
